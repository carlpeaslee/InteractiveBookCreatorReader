# Plot.Cool

Two years ago, I began work on an interactive digital novel but soon found that there were few tools available to writers interested in creating interactive and dynamic digital content. 

Plot.Cool is a web app and IDE that empowers content creators to gather immediate feedback from users and harness that data to dynamically generate new, individually tailored content.

I built Plot.Cool with the MEAN stack and leveraged mobile first design principles to reduce barriers for readers interested in submitting data or otherwise participating in the site.

It's definitely still a work in progress so I'd love your feedback or thoughts on anything from design to code to creative writing!
